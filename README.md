# Churn-Predictor
  A project for machine learning class where multiple machine learning models were used to determine if a customer will prolong their contract or not. Aim of the project was to train a classifier on a given data that the answers were given (called dataset in the project) and then use it to predict results on a data that the answers were not given (called queries in the project).
  
  After submitting queries predictions we were given scores. Ultimately the best result was achieved with AdaBoost Classificator (ROC AUC score was used as a metric) and earned me a 2nd place in the class.
Whole project was written in python using: **pandas**, **numpy**, **scikit-learn**, **seaborn** and **matplotlib** libraries.
